#### Project Overview

CLEARX Cosmetics faces a significant business challenge in effectively monitoring and optimizing its sales performance across its branches. The key obstacles the company encounters include:

 A. Data Fragmentation: Sales data is collected manually across the two branches, leading to fragmented, error-prone records.
 
 B. Limited Data Analysis: The lack of data analysis tools hinders the company's ability to gain insights into product performance, customer preferences, and regional trends.
 
 C. Resource Allocation: CLEARX Cosmetics struggles to allocate resources efficiently, leading to stockouts or overstock situations.
